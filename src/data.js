        description:"New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at every turn, from dramatic mountains to spectacular fjords. Here, you can admire the mountains of Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from hiking trails or a boat on Milford Sound. At night, journey to the University of Canterbury's Mount John Observatory to gaze at the starry skies. You can also indulge your inner daredevil in Queenstown (a favorite destination among bungee jumpers), sample delicious sauvignon blanc wine in the Marlborough region or explore New Zealand's most accessible glaciers – Franz Josef and Fox Glacier – on the island's west coast.",

But what travelers really fall in love with are the city's quaint cafes, vibrant markets, trendy shopping districts and unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Get lost wandering along the charming cobblestone streets, or grab a croissant and relax on the banks of the Seine for hours. If you're up for a quick daytrip, head about 15 miles southwest of the city center to the Palace of Versailles, which offers guided and self-guided tours of the estate.",

Don't miss a chance to visit Haleakala National Park, which is home to one of the world's largest dormant volcanic craters.

The island's extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and soft white sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny.",
